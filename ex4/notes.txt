After finishing nominal assignment, check timing:

Checking Cost Function (w/ Regularization) ... 
Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): 0.383770 
(this value should be about 0.383770)
Total/user/system CPU time for nnCostFunction= 2.748000 / 2.708000 / 0.040000 
Program paused. Press enter to continue.

=== after completing the vectorization of the code ===
(except for the small for loop to fill the y matrix)

Checking Cost Function (w/ Regularization) ... 
Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): 0.383770 
(this value should be about 0.383770)
Total/user/system CPU time for nnCostFunction= 0.380000 / 0.316000 / 0.064000 
Program paused. Press enter to continue.


== not bad!
